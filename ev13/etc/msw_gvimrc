"====== mouse/... of gui: ===============================
" --- mouse-right-click problem in mswin (see also :h mousemodel ) :
" if wanted mouse-right-click do popup-menu (and NOT the default extend-selection), then have to first activate the mouse with: set mouse=a ; set mousemodel=popup 
" --!- so setting to popup works ONLY if mouse is active at all! so if eg mouse=a ! otherwise has NO effect ! 
" so the least solution for riright-click-paste in insert-mode is: set mouse=i ; set mousemodel=popup
"
" --- mouse-middle-click to paste:  again here/doppel if middle-mouse-click always work??:
" middle-mouse-click-paste_Lx in mswin:  middle-mouse-signal on mswins mapped to insert-paste as in Lx in both normal+insert-modes :
